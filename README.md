# UK-makerspaces
An open dataset of makerspaces in the UK

This Github repository provides access to the open dataset of UK makerspaces. 

The dataset contains all of the publicly releasable information on the 97 makerspaces we identified in our research. We have separated the dataset into identifiable data and anonymised data.

Open dataset of UK makerspaces - identifiable data is linked to makerspaces and includes information on location, space, tools and materials, membership and users, amenities and services, external relationships, legal structure and founders, as well as aspirations and challenges. This is available in machine-readable CSV format with accompanying JSON tabular data package, and a ‘human readable’ PDF format can be accessed via http://www.nesta.org.uk/UK-makerspaces/dataset.

Open dataset of UK makerspaces - anonymised data has been anonymised and includes information on makerspace turnover, income, expenditure and business rates. This is available in machine-readable CSV format.
