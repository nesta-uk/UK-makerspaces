This was our 'seed hackspace', it did was not our own space par-se, but did allow us to keep active tools and workbenches in a shared co-working office space. We could use the space out-of-hours when the office workers were gone, and had a dedicated night of our own.It was a good seed space, since the cost was considerably lower than a dedicated 24x7 space. However, I do feel that this meant many of the original membership lost the original vision to get our own space - the net result being finding our own dedicated space took longer than originally hoped - 2 years rather than 6 months.",Leased from private landlord,150, (1614.6 sq ft),01/09/2011,,,"Member (or keyholder) access any time, Public access in set hours, Public access for courses or training only","We currently work on a 'pay what you want, but pay monthly' policy, with a £5 per month minimum. This is paid by direct debit, standing order, or paypal. We try to encourage people to pay what they think the space is worth to them, essentially an honesty system.Our average is about £16 per member, with a min of £5, and max £30.","For public access, i'd like to make it clear that 'public access' does not permit the public to use many of the tools. We have an open night on Thursday evening, and a generally welcoming stance any other time, but we are careful to ensure that whilst the *space* is open to the public, the *tools* are largely off-limits.We host public workshops, which are supervised and are covered under our insurance.For members to get 24x7 access to the space, we operate a 'vouching' process, where the trustees essentially get to know the new member directly or via other members reports. Once a trustee is happy that the new member is trustworthy, they are permitted to have keys and be on their own in the space.Some equipment in the space is off-limits to people that are not competent on that machinery. Typically we charge a fee for access to this specialist equipment (eg laser cutter, lathe, welding) to maintain a pot of money for maintenance and upgrades. This is sometimes misconstrued as a training fee, which it is not. All training in the space, outside of organised public workshops, is done on a member to member basis.","pay what you want, but pay monthly (with suggested minimum) ",5,"Long term project storage, Shared kitchen, Bookable event space, Social, non-working area, Toilets, Library, Wifi, Wired ethernet, Honesty system tuckshop",Children allowed in workspace,"The space is not wheelchair accessible unfortunately, due to the location within the general Rodhus building.Children are permitted in the space, but under supervision of a parent or nominated guardian.

This consisting of three distinct areas that provide a city wide benefit:This will be achieved by BML activity taking place every day throughout the year across two locations and as a schools and libraries programme: 1. BML Central - A city-centre location houses activities for individuals, artists, SMEs, and University and corporate teams, with easy access to smaller scale designing and prototyping, along with collaboration space and child care. Users pay for a membership package or take up a residency funded by other organisations.2. BML Factory - A South Bristol location, in Knowle Wests new Filwood Green Business Park (completion February 2015), provides a digital manufacturing floor that is a training ground for young people and adults who want to upskill. Many of the courses are funded allowing participants to gain both practical and life skills working on live com- missions with professionals.3. Maker Lab in a Box:SchoolsWith our mobile schools programme we will give children and young peoplepractical experience of digital manufacturing, enhancing their awareness of the possible careers of the future at a young age (Primary),and teaching them transferable skills foremployment (Secondary). This will begin in March 2015 with a year of experiments with six South Bristol schools. In three primary schools and three secondrary schools we are working with teachers, artists, technologists, pupils, trainees and apprentices to find creative and innovative ways of delivering the new ICT and computing curriculums and making technology more visible in schools.LibrariesWe are working with Bristol Libraries to help them respond in creative and sustainable ways to the changed environment of public spending cuts and the implications of new digital technology. In 2015 we will develop bespoke Maker Lab experiences to suit the needs of individual libraries, starting with the Central Library and continuingacross the city.","We are meeting the challenge of aiming to allow community access for all to a maker space. This requires a different business model to other spaces we have researched.There has also been some issue around storage in the furniture project to allow larger scale production to take place. Along with adequate break out social space to coexist to ensure we maintain an environment enjoyable to all. We would also have to say that as many other spaces will testify that developing reliable sustainable income streams are always a challenge.Whilst the three distinct areas of delivery that we aim to reach have different target audiences that all present different opportunities and challenges.","We have been commissioned for a design and build contract to make new open source design furniture using digital manufacturing techniques. Also to use the same techniques to influence the up-cycling of old furniture for Midas construction company who are leading on a new build ""Filwood Green Business Park"". This initiative has allowed us to employ and train local community members to develop digital manufacturing skills to fulfil the contract.

Although this has ultimately secured us a much lower rent than we could have got in a commercial space (£3000 a year for a space that could easily cost 15 times that much on the open market), it meant we had to raise a significant amount of capital to begin with: £210,000 for our construction / refurbishment work. This took a long time for a largely volunteer group, and could not all be raised in one go (it came as three grants of £100K, £60K and £50K from different sources - local authority and two charitable foundations - raised over a period of 4 years, and spent over 2.5 years, with about £20K currently remaining). This meant the building work was a rather stop-start process: in particular the third grant was conditional on having our 15 year lease finalised by the council, which took 3 years from agreeing heads of terms to getting the final document signed. For the last year of this we were waiting with almost no money in the bank, so we had to stop the building work and start using the workshops as best we could in their incomplete state. We have also encountered some problems in the form of serious and entrenched disputes between members, though eventually these were resolved in a peaceful manner (with external mediators involved), and resulted in the creation of a Code of Conduct.A related issue has been the difficulties of sharing space for storage when this is not demarcated into separate spaces for different individuals / companies. People have different views about what materials are ""upcyclable"" and what quantities and condition of materials the Remakery should accept; some members have also abused what should be shared space as a depot for their personal storage. These issues are being resolved over time - through the introduction of rules, procedures, and space demarcations - but have caused many delays because the physical moving around of stuff is time-consuming.","A group called the Cover Girls began as a team of volunteers re-upholstering ragged old office chairs for the Remakery to use in our co-working space. Their colourful combinations of fabrics gave the chairs a new lease of life and caught the eye of many visitors, leading to purchases, commissions and a shop in Brixton starting to retail the chairs. Although it's early days and it's by no means a full-time business yet, the Cover Girls team continues to grow and provide opportunities for more people to learn new skills that can bring creative satisfaction and make money."

Fees would then cover a portion of the running costs of the community centre and possibly project equipment which couldn't be begged, borrowed, made or donated. ","Open Hub is an experiment, we are co-designing it with residents, and working alongside existing traditional uses of the community centre. We design each project with interested people, and at this stage simply figure out access that works for the project and the volunteers on the centre committee who share keys.

Helping parents to rationalise that computer gaming can also be used as a tool to achieve a positive outcome they can understand with a little of help vs. the common held belief that it's a waste of time within an educational context and purely for entertainment; all games teach skills; Minecraft for instance teaches the principals of CAD which with a scaffolded skills transfers maps well to using the commercial CAD tool. Try teaching CAD to someone who simply does not understand the fundamental, it's a horrible experience vs. giving it to a Minecraft gamer, where for several reasons it's more likely to be a fun experience and meaningful experience.

Our members are extremely good in helping anybody with any challenge to participate as fully as possible, including when we go to camping festivals, and when someone with a situation turns up to the studio, the space erupts as people sort themselves out to help and make space.","Currently there is no list that is accurate.  Soon we will move spaces though, to open in May 2015 at the new place, and the base list of those major tools is in this post:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/oxford-hackspace/qbKXFabDybc/bJCNr5RbpCEJ","One room, no dirty work inside but ok in the carpark or corridor depending.  Room has tables and chairs, shelves, no extraction or things that need it yet.","All kinds of things, chisels, about 50 screwdrivers, measuring tapes and rulers, precision calipers, hammers, that sort of thing.","Drill, circular saw, soldering irons, glue gun, dremel with selection of heads, 4 sewing machines, and various PCB-related things. Two 3D printers, one Makerbot Cupcake (working) and one donated.....something, large and fancy, slightly not working at the moment.",Nothing large yet.  Give us two months and lots of good things are on order.,None at the space yet.  All coming for May 2015.,"None, metalworking other than forge coming for May.",None that I'm particularly aware of at the moment.,"4 sewing machines, one industrial.","None at the moment, kiln coming sometime after we open the new space in May.","None at the moment, though plans to build a vacuum former in the new space and vinyl cutter may be purchased.",None at the moment.  Will likely have some things related to this in the new space as kiln is spec'd for glasswork and we have at least two interested parties.,None at the moment.,None.  Users bring them in at the moment if wanted.,None but photography area under discussion for new space.,"None, but microscope at least to come for new space.  Discussion of biohacking hasn't gotten this far.","Two computers for public use, one kinect, menu and banking system connected to tablet on the front  of the fridge. See ""Revbank system.""  Also a Pi that runs some services.","Two 3D printers at the moment only and nice calipers.  In the new space, A0 80W laser cutter, Tormach metal mill or similar, Shopbot PRSAlpha wood router etc.  Not sure what we will have for the smaller stuff yet, perhaps a Roland mill.","Soldering irons, oscilloscopes old and new, bench and some other power supplies. Large coils of wire for member use and the beginnings of a components shop in lots of small drawers.","Not much at the moment though lots of interest in music.  Full-sized guitar, 3/4 guitar, sometimes ukelele which are going up on the wall, as well as a half-sized electronic keyboard.  Clock is slightly dodgily made from an audio DJ mixing platform thing with lots of luminous buttons.  Chiptunes performers and former army drummers and singers and piano players are members and there is a small musical flashmobs group that hasn't yet done anything.  Microphones currently lousy and need upgrading, though there are members with professional-grade cameras and such for talks and performances.",None particularly for this use.,"Not sure what this would include, but I'm sure it wouldn't fit at the moment!","Several projectors, tables, large television on an arm on the wall for workshops and for people who want to play ""Day-O"" loudly during social night for trolling reasons.","Not much assembled for this, though there are pieces about.","Probably!  Lots of artists, musicians, a few public performers and some people who want to do quite hard science, but we've not yet been able to properly support much because of space constraints.  In the new space.","We have groups that do a lot of things, it depends what you mean by this.  We don't invite only certain types of people, no, we like as much breadth as possible.  We do have people who eg. would like to produce software with our name on it, people who used to or still do work for F1, a load of musicians, and other things.  A whole range of skills.","At the moment, pretty much everything but the circular saw is fine for use.  Saw users need to show they are competent.  One sewing machine belongs to a member so only carefully-selected gentle people can use it as it was broken by carelessness once already.At the new space, pretty much everything big will be after induction only, with access control connected to RFID fobs.  We and Science Oxford both take safety very seriously and there are lots of untrained people about this part of town.","At the moment, none, though one sewing machine has restricted use.  In the new space, at least the Shopbot will be staff-use only, at least until we can convince those needing convincing (insurance, Science Oxford) that people are appropriately trained.  We may have to make them be appropriately trained by holding full-on proper certification courses from external agencies in the space.","Only sewing machine due to prior expensive breakage.  When ukeleles are in, use is after being whitelisted by owners, though that's not very well-enforced. There are various devices with stickers on about that have various levels of permissions, like the X-Box, one nice soldering iron, a laser box that used to be in a club(?), and other things.",No,"No, users bring their own","Fabrics, yarns, Wood and derivatives, Paper and card, Electronics, Inks, paints",Not at the moment.,Yes,Yes,"43 paying members as of 15-03-15.

At the moment there is one project starting up in the space, to make a game.  There is at least one former Linux kernel developer in the space frequently.  One person is a moderator of English Stack Exchange and one person is extremely active on Programmer's Stack Exchange.",No.,"No.  Surrounded mainly be flats, university dorms and council flats, so it wouldn't be very appropriate, but (some of) the more nearby bits of the business school know about us.","Yes, UK hackspaces, hackerspaces.org, and others.","We have close links with London Hackspace and we visit back and forth and help each other where possible.  After that, it depends who you ask.  In one case: Swindon Hackspace are friends who have come for a workshop and hacker camp, and people at Nottinghack and others have been helpful in our proposal-writing.  We keep contact with one of the members who is somewhat of a leader at RevSpace in the Netherlands as well.",Yes,Informal group,"There were about 10-15 initial co-founders who attended the meeting where we adopted our first constitution and became an unincorporated voluntary association.  It depends what you mean by founders.  They were a mix of self-employed people, students, and people with jobs mainly in science and engineering, who were in their early thirties, early twenties and early forties.  The two current active co-founding directors are both self-employed (thank god), one as a legal and technical translator with a background in law/politics/charities from Canada and one as a programmer and electrical engineer.","Unincorporated association, will soon be a CLG before the move.","This is an enormous question, especially when you are asking it to a collective.  We'd settle for helping everyone achieve their potential, advancing the state of the art in science and helping all people, especially children, minorities and women achieve all the education they want.  Personal autonomy, diversified social support, exciting opportunities and the ability to dream big for everyone.  Individual officers and members have extensive ideas about what greatness would look like.","Some people need more social support than we are equipped to give.  Consensus-based decision-making is great for helping people feel included, but rubbish for getting to any decision or for providing quick answers or physical deliverables when there are deadlines.  Having no real ""leader"" is obnoxious for outside organizations who wish to deal with us sensibly (and arguably internally, depending on who you ask). Endless discussion will also burn people out and cause them to quit.  The safety model for hackspaces in general has the potential to be dodgy and spaces can collapse if there are court cases--this needs to be resolved without breaking the freedom model of spaces, perhaps with a new type of group insurance.  Some people still think ""hack"" means blackhats or worse.  Trust-based organizations are susceptible to major growing pains as they get bigger.  The amount of work it takes to set up a space and run it for free is enormously larger than anybody thinks and people have to take a year off work (no joke, this is confirmed at several spaces I know of).  If they were able to be paid even for one day a week somehow in the early stages, a lot of stress, anxiety and tears could be saved and the human-sacrificial model of space foundation could come to an end, with more health for people trying to establish and run these, and more spaces globally as a result.  Burnout is bad. Also, being female in these organizations is in some ways much easier and more respectful than the literature suggests, and in other subtle ways (like having a total lack of ""basic knowledge"" of tools or electronics and not enough time to catch up to understand space conversations), very exclusionary.","There are a lot of stories, some which aren't to be published (for example about mental health), and several start-ups have been founded/contributed to/positively affected by our existence."
